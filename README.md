# Singularity Orb Example

This is an example of the [Circle CI Orb](https://circleci.com/orbs/registry/) to help you 
interact with [Singularity containers](https://www.github.com/sylabs/singularity).

## Usage

### Configure

Fork or otherwise clone / copy the repository here, or as an alternative
just copy the [.circleci/config.yml](.circleci/config.yml) file to
your repository.

### Customize

Customize the file with your build recipe, and name. There is a very basic
example in the file itself. If you want a custom example then 
[open an issue](https://www.github.com/singularityhub/singularity-orb-example)
and I'll write it for you! 


#### What can I customize?

You can generally customize:

 - the Singularity version
 - the container name
 - the from uri (e.g., docker:// versus a Singularity recipe)

#### How do I...

I will write more documentation and examples at the request of users, so please
ask if you would like an example for your purposes.
